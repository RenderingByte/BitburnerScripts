> A somewhat powerful and automated script that will carry you throughout your Bitburner journey.

ByteScript is a script written in Netscript 2 (NS2) that automatically (ON EVERY MACHINE YOU CAN CURRENTLY CONNECT TO)

* Attempts to open as many ports as possible
* Attempts to get root (nuke)
* Copies/Replaces itself on every machine you can connect to (in order for script updates to take effect)
* Hacks/Grows/Weakens automatically
